# 176. Second Highest Salary

Write a SQL query to get the second highest salary from the Employee table.

+----+--------+
| Id | Salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
For example, given the above Employee table, the query should return 200 as the second highest salary. If there is no second highest salary, then the query should return null.

+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| 200                 |
+---------------------+




Solution 1: 

Order the distinct values of the salaries, 
then return the second highest using limit and offset.
In order to return NULL if the result is empty,
give the result an alias (select ... as ...).
```
SELECT
    (SELECT DISTINCT Salary
        FROM Employee
        ORDER BY Salary DESC
        LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1) AS SecondHighestSalary
;
```


Solution 2: 

Same as solution 1, 
but use IFNULL to bypass the situation where result is empty.
```
SELECT
    IFNULL(
      (SELECT DISTINCT Salary
       FROM Employee
       ORDER BY Salary DESC
        LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1),
    NULL) AS SecondHighestSalary
```

Solution 3:



Use the max function twice.
```
SELECT MAX(Salary) AS SecondHighestSalary 
FROM Employee 
WHERE Salary NOT IN (SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM Employee);
```
