# Introduction to SQL

SQL: Structured Query Language, a language for interacting with data stored in something called a relational database.

This note summarizes the most basic syntax in SQL shared by many types of databases, such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, and Oracle. 

## SELECT from a single table

Select data in columns c1, c2 from table t:

```
SELECT c1, c2 FROM t;
```

Select all rows and columns from table t:

```
SELECT * FROM t;
```
Select data in columns c1, c2 from table t under a condition:

```
SELECT c1, c2 FROM t
WHERE condition;
```

Select distinct rows from table t:

```
SELECT DISTINCT c1 FROM t;
```
